To see the visualizations, run the visualizations.py module. The filepaths in the main method at the bottom will need to be modified based on where you store the dataset. The ml_methods.py module also uses a local path to load the data, so update that as well. Then simply run the entire file.

My (Ben Royce)'s contribution to the project was the ml_methods.py file and half of the report.
